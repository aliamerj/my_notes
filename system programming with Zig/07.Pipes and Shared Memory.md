# Pipes and Shared Memory
## 1. Pipes
**Overview**: Pipes allow for unidirectional communication between a producer (writing end) and a consumer (reading end). A pipe is treated like a file by UNIX, although it operates in memory.
provide a unidirectional communication channel between processes. In a typical use case, one process writes data to the pipe, and another reads it. Pipes are one of the oldest IPC (Inter-Process Communication) mechanisms.

### General Concepts
- **Unidirectional**: Data flows from a writer process to a reader process in one direction.
- **Anonymous Pipes**: Used primarily between processes that have a parent-child relationship. The parent creates the pipe before forking, and the child inherits the pipe.
- **Named Pipes (FIFOs)**: Unlike anonymous pipes, named pipes can be used by unrelated processes. These pipes exist as special files in the filesystem.
- **Blocking and Non-blocking**: If a process tries to read from an empty pipe, it may block until data is written (blocking mode). In non-blocking mode, the read operation fails if no data is available.

### Pipes in Linux
- System Calls:
    - pipe() creates an anonymous pipe, returning two file descriptors: one for reading and one for writing.
    - mkfifo() creates a named pipe, which can be accessed via the filesystem like a regular file.
- Data Size Limits: Linux pipes have a buffer size, often set to 65536 bytes. If the buffer is full, the writing process will block until there’s space, unless it uses non-blocking mode.

**Usage**: A pipe is created using `pipe(int fileDescriptors[])`, where:
- fileDescriptors[0]: reading end
- fileDescriptors[1]: writing end
**Limitations**: Pipes are unidirectional. For bidirectional communication, two pipes are required.

**Anonymous Pipes**: Exist only while processes communicate. They are tied to file descriptors, requiring a parent-child relationship.

**Named Pipes (FIFO)**: Persist beyond process lifetime and can be bidirectional but only in one direction at a time (use two pipes for concurrent bidirectional communication). Named pipes are created using `mkfifo()`.

**Example**: A simple pipe communication example involves using fork() to create a parent-child relationship, where the parent writes a message, and the child reads it.
### Pipes in Zig:
In Zig, you can use system calls directly, much like in C. Here’s a simple pipe example:
```zig
const std = @import("std");

pub fn main() void {
    const pipe_fds = try std.os.pipe();

    var writer = pipe_fds[1];
    var reader = pipe_fds[0];

    try std.os.write(writer, "Hello from Zig!\n");
    
    var buffer: [128]u8 = undefined;
    const bytes_read = try std.os.read(reader, &buffer);

    std.debug.print("Read {} bytes: {s}", .{bytes_read, buffer[0..bytes_read]});
}
```
This code uses the standard library’s `std.os.pipe()` to create a pipe and transfers data between two file descriptors.

### Example in Zig
Here’s a Zig implementation for the Pipes example and Shared Memory example, focusing on how we can create inter-process communication between a parent and child process.
```zig
const std = @import("std");

pub fn main() void {
    const buffer_size = 25;
    const write_msg = "Greetings";
    var read_msg: [buffer_size]u8 = undefined;

    var pipefd: [2]i32 = undefined;
    std.os.pipe(&pipefd) catch std.debug.panic("Pipe creation failed");

    const pid = std.os.fork() catch std.debug.panic("Fork failed");

    if (pid == 0) {
        // Child process
        std.os.close(pipefd[1]) catch std.debug.panic("Close write end failed");
        std.os.read(pipefd[0], &read_msg) catch std.debug.panic("Read failed");
        std.debug.print("Read from pipe: {}\n", .{read_msg[0..std.mem.len(write_msg)]});
        std.os.close(pipefd[0]) catch std.debug.panic("Close read end failed");
    } else {
        // Parent process
        std.os.close(pipefd[0]) catch std.debug.panic("Close read end failed");
        std.os.write(pipefd[1], write_msg) catch std.debug.panic("Write failed");
        std.os.close(pipefd[1]) catch std.debug.panic("Close write end failed");
    }
}
```


## 2. Shared Memory
- **Overview**: Shared memory provides a shared region between multiple processes. Once a shared memory segment is set up, processes can directly read and write to it without system calls. This leads to faster communication compared to pipes.
*Shared memory* allows multiple processes to access the same memory space. It's the fastest form of IPC because processes can directly read/write to a common area in memory without needing to transfer data through kernel-based mechanisms (like pipes).

### General Concepts
- **Memory Mapping**: Shared memory is typically implemented using memory-mapped files or system-specific mechanisms like shmget in UNIX-based systems.
- **Synchronization**: Since multiple processes access the same memory, synchronization is essential to avoid race conditions. Typically, you use mutexes, semaphores, or other synchronization mechanisms.
- **Efficient for Large Data**: Shared memory is often used when large amounts of data need to be exchanged between processes because it's much faster than copying data back and forth between kernel space and user space (as in pipes).

### Workflow:
  1. Create a shared memory segment using shmget().
  2. Attach the shared memory using shmat() to map the shared segment into a process's address space.
  3. Read/Write to the shared memory directly.
  4. Detach from the shared memory using shmdt() once done.
  5. Delete the shared memory segment using shmctl() after all processes detach.

**Synchronization Issue**: Shared memory requires proper synchronization to avoid one process overwriting the changes of another.

### Shared Memory in Linux
- System Calls:
    - `shmget()`: Creates a shared memory segment.
    - `shmat()`: Attaches the shared memory segment to the process’s address space.
    - `shmdt()`: Detaches the shared memory segment.
    - `shmctl()`: Performs control operations on the shared memory (e.g., removing it).


In Zig, shared memory can be handled using mmap for mapping memory that can be shared between processes.
```zig
const std = @import("std");

pub fn main() void {
    const page_size = std.os.page_size();
    const shared_mem = try std.os.mmap(
        null,
        page_size,
        std.os.PROT_READ | std.os.PROT_WRITE,
        std.os.MAP_SHARED | std.os.MAP_ANONYMOUS,
        -1,
        0,
    );
    defer std.os.munmap(shared_mem, page_size);

    var buffer = shared_mem[0..10];
    buffer[0] = 'Z';
    buffer[1] = 'i';
    buffer[2] = 'g';

    std.debug.print("Shared memory says: {s}\n", .{buffer[0..3]});
}
```
This example allocates shared memory using `mmap()` and writes some data into it.

### Shared Memory in Zig
```zig
const std = @import("std");

pub fn main() void {
    const shm_size = 32;

    // Create shared memory segment
    const shmid = std.os.shmget(std.os.IPC_PRIVATE, shm_size, std.os.IPC_CREAT | 0o666) catch std.debug.panic("Failed to create shared memory");

    const pid = std.os.fork() catch std.debug.panic("Fork failed");

    if (pid == 0) {
        // Child process
        const shmaddr = std.os.shmat(shmid, null, 0) catch std.debug.panic("Failed to attach shared memory");
        std.mem.set(u8, shmaddr[0..shm_size], 0); // Initialize memory
        std.mem.copy(u8, shmaddr[0..11], "Hello World");
        std.os.shmdt(shmaddr) catch std.debug.panic("Failed to detach shared memory");
    } else {
        // Parent process
        std.os.waitpid(pid, 0) catch std.debug.panic("Wait failed");
        const shmaddr = std.os.shmat(shmid, null, 0) catch std.debug.panic("Failed to attach shared memory");
        std.debug.print("Message from child: {}\n", .{shmaddr[0..11]});
        std.os.shmdt(shmaddr) catch std.debug.panic("Failed to detach shared memory");
        std.os.shmctl(shmid, std.os.IPC_RMID, null) catch std.debug.panic("Failed to delete shared memory");
    }
}
```
### Additional Information
- Pipes are ideal for simple, unidirectional data streams. Shared memory is preferred when you need more complex, faster communication, but it requires careful synchronization.
- Use mkfifo for named pipes when persistence or communication beyond parent-child processes is needed.

### Pipes vs Shared Memory:
- Pipes are simpler and can be useful for small, sequential communication between processes. However, they involve the overhead of data copying.
- Shared memory is more complex but provides direct access to memory, making it more efficient for large data transfers. It requires careful synchronization to avoid race conditions.

Zig and System Calls: In Zig, you directly work with Linux system calls through the standard library (std.os). You can manage pipes, shared memory, and other IPC mechanisms as you would in C, but with Zig's memory safety features.
