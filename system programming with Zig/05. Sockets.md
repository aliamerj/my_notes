# Sockets and Network Communication
While methods like pipes and shared memory are used when processes are on the same machine, communication across machines (or even between processes on the same machine using the network) requires sockets. Sockets provide the means for communication via datagrams (like sending letters) or connection streams (like making a phone call). Let's break down the essential components and usage of sockets.

## What is a Socket?
A socket is an abstraction that allows processes to communicate over the network. Sockets can either use:
- Datagrams (SOCK_DGRAM): Messages are sent without a connection, similar to sending letters. Data may arrive out of order or be lost.
- Streams (SOCK_STREAM): A reliable connection-oriented stream of bytes, where data is sent and received like a phone call. TCP/IP is often used here.
- Raw Sockets (SOCK_RAW): Lower-level access for protocols like ICMP.

**Socket: A communication endpoint allowing for data exchange between devices or processes. It operates over the network (Internet, local communication, etc.).**

## Creating a Socket
To create a socket, we use the socket() system call. It takes the following parameters:
- domain: Address family (e.g., AF_INET for IPv4).
- type: Communication type (e.g., SOCK_STREAM for TCP, SOCK_DGRAM for UDP).
- protocol: Specifies the protocol (usually 0 to use the default, such as TCP for SOCK_STREAM).
The `socket()` call returns a `file descriptor` that represents the socket, which is used to send/receive data. Just like a file, it needs to be closed after use.

### Five Main Steps to Create a Socket:
  1. Socket Creation (socket()): Establishes a socket endpoint.
  2. Binding (bind()): Assigns a socket to an address (IP + port).
  3. Listening (listen()): Marks the socket as a passive listener for incoming connections.
  4. Accepting (accept()): Accepts an incoming connection.
  5. Sending/Receiving Data (send(), recv()): Transmitting or receiving data.

## Network Byte Order
Data sent over the network must use a consistent byte order (big-endian). 
Functions like htonl() and htons() help convert values to network byte order, while ntohl() and ntohs() convert them back to the host system’s byte order.

## Addressing and Ports
  - IP Addresses: These are like street addresses for computers (e.g., 192.168.0.1).
  - Ports: Ports are used to differentiate services running on the same machine. For example, port 22 is for SSH.

## Hostname Lookup
To resolve human-readable hostnames into IP addresses, we use the `getaddrinfo()` function. 
This replaces the older gethostbyname() function and provides more flexibility for specifying the kind of connection (e.g., IPv4, stream sockets).

## Client and Server Roles
  - Client: The client connects to a server using the connect() function.
  - Server: The server must listen for connections using bind(), listen(), and accept() functions.
## Example in Zig
Here’s how you would create a simple TCP client in Zig that connects to a server using IPv4. This example demonstrates creating a socket, setting up an address structure, and establishing a connection.

```zig
const std = @import("std");
const net = std.net;

pub fn main() !void {
    const allocator = std.heap.page_allocator;

    var socket = try net.Socket.init(.{ .tcp = true }, net.AddressFamily.ipv4);
    defer socket.deinit();

    // Server address and port
    var address = try net.Address.ipv4("127.0.0.1", 2520);

    // Connect to the server
    try socket.connect(address);

    // Send a message to the server
    const message = "Hello, Server!";
    try socket.write(message);

    // Read response from the server
    var buf: [1024]u8 = undefined;
    const bytes_read = try socket.read(&buf);
    std.debug.print("Received: {s}\n", .{buf[0..bytes_read]});

    // Close the socket
    try socket.shutdown(.both);
}
```
1. Creating the Socket:

We initialize the socket using net.Socket.init(), specifying tcp = true to create a TCP socket (stream).
Setting Up the Address:

We create an IPv4 address for the loopback address (127.0.0.1) on port 2520.
2. Connecting:

The socket.connect() method establishes the connection to the server.
3. Communication:

We send a message to the server using socket.write(), and read the response with socket.read().
Closing the Socket:

Finally, the socket is closed gracefully using socket.shutdown().

## Additional Notes:
- Endianess: Ensure that integers sent over the network are in big-endian format using functions like htonl() and htons(). Zig takes care of most of this through its standard library, but it's important to remember this if working at a lower level.

- getaddrinfo: Zig abstracts away much of the complexity of using getaddrinfo() via its networking API, so you don’t need to deal with struct details unless working directly with the OS.
## Blocking vs Non-blocking Sockets:
- Blocking: The system call waits until it completes (e.g., accept() waits for a connection).
- Non-blocking: The call returns immediately with a result (e.g., no connection yet or data available).
**Non-blocking sockets are essential for scalable, event-driven applications.**

## Linux-Specific Socket Notes:
- Linux APIs:
    - epoll: Efficiently handles multiple socket connections using event notification. Provides better performance than older approaches like select() and poll() by avoiding scanning large lists of file descriptors.
- Socket options (setsockopt()): Allows fine-tuning of socket behavior, such as setting TCP_NODELAY to disable Nagle’s algorithm for low-latency connections.
- Common Socket Syscalls:
    - socket(), bind(), listen(), accept(), connect(), send(), recv(), close().
    - Non-blocking mode: Use fcntl() to set a socket in non-blocking mode (O_NONBLOCK).

## Zig-Specific Socket Notes:
Socket Handling in Zig:
  - In Zig, you use the std.os and std.net libraries for system calls and networking.
  - Example of creating a basic socket in Zig:

```zig
const std = @import("std");
const net = std.net;
const os = std.os;

pub fn main() !void {
    var listener = try net.SocketAddress.parseIp("127.0.0.1", 8080);
    var server = try net.Socket.listen(net.AddressFamily.ipv4, &listener);
    try server.accept(); // Accept incoming connections
}
```
## Non-blocking I/O:
  Zig also supports non-blocking I/O through `std.os.linux` APIs for epoll and event-driven socket handling.
  To convert a socket to non-blocking mode
  ```zig
try os.fcntl(server_handle, os.F_SETFL, os.O_NONBLOCK);
```
## Best Practices:
- Error Handling: Always handle errors gracefully, especially when dealing with non-blocking sockets (EAGAIN or EWOULDBLOCK errors).
- Socket Timeouts: Set timeouts using setsockopt() to avoid indefinitely waiting for data (important in blocking mode).

- Security Considerations:
    - SSL/TLS: Use encryption (via libraries like OpenSSL or native Zig libraries) for secure communication.
    - Firewall and Permissions: Ensure the socket has appropriate permissions, and firewall rules allow traffic through the desired port.
