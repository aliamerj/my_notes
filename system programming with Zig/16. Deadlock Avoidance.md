# Summary of Deadlock Avoidance Lecture

## Deadlock Avoidance

In deadlock avoidance, instead of entirely preventing deadlock by eliminating one of the necessary conditions for its occurrence, we focus on dynamically avoiding it by ensuring that a system never enters a "deadlock-prone" state. The core strategy is to avoid forming cycles in the resource allocation graph.

## Ordering of Resources

One simple method is to enforce an ordering of resources. In this approach, each resource is assigned a unique integer (or some predefined order), and processes must request resources in increasing order according to this assignment. If resources are requested in a non-circular order, a deadlock cannot occur. This is because the circular wait condition (one of the four deadlock conditions) is avoided.

For example, in the dining philosophers problem, assigning numbers to chopsticks and requiring each philosopher to pick up chopsticks in ascending order prevents deadlock.

## Safe and Unsafe States

Another approach involves defining safe and unsafe states. A state is safe if there exists at least one sequence in which every process can complete its execution without entering a deadlock. An unsafe state does not guarantee deadlock, but there is a possibility of deadlock occurring.

The system can monitor resource requests dynamically and only grant requests if doing so does not transition the system into an unsafe state. This way, deadlock is avoided by ensuring that the system remains in a safe state.

## Resource-Allocation Graph Algorithm

In cases where resources have only one instance, deadlock can be avoided by using a resource allocation graph. This graph represents the relationships between processes and resources. The graph includes request edges, allocation edges, and a new edge type, claim edges, which indicate that a process might request a resource in the future. A request is only granted if converting the claim edge into an allocation edge does not introduce a cycle in the graph.

## Banker's Algorithm

The Bankerâ€™s Algorithm is a more generalized approach that handles multiple instances of a resource. It is named after a banker who must ensure that cash allocations do not lead to an inability to satisfy future withdrawals. The system checks if granting a resource request leaves the system in a safe state. If not, the request is denied, avoiding deadlock.

## Zig Example for Deadlock Avoidance

Let's implement a basic simulation of deadlock avoidance using resource ordering in Zig.
Zig Example: Enforcing Resource Ordering
```zig
const std = @import("std");

const Mutex = struct {
    lock_status: bool,
};

fn initMutex() Mutex {
    return Mutex{
        .lock_status = false,
    };
}

fn acquire(m: *Mutex) void {
    while (m.lock_status) {
        // Busy waiting for lock to be available
    }
    m.lock_status = true;
}

fn release(m: *Mutex) void {
    m.lock_status = false;
}

pub fn main() void {
    const stdout = std.io.getStdOut().writer();
    
    var mutex1 = initMutex();
    var mutex2 = initMutex();

    const thread1 = std.Thread.spawn(main, {
        acquire(&mutex1);
        acquire(&mutex2);
        stdout.print("Thread 1 acquired both resources\n", .{}) catch {};
        release(&mutex2);
        release(&mutex1);
    }, .{}) catch unreachable;

    const thread2 = std.Thread.spawn(main, {
        acquire(&mutex1);
        acquire(&mutex2);
        stdout.print("Thread 2 acquired both resources\n", .{}) catch {};
        release(&mutex2);
        release(&mutex1);
    }, .{}) catch unreachable;

    thread1.join() catch {};
    thread2.join() catch {};
}
```
In this example, we simulate two threads acquiring resources (mutex1 and mutex2). By always acquiring mutex1 before mutex2, we avoid deadlock by ensuring a consistent resource ordering.

## Translation of C code to Zig

If a C program involves acquiring resources in a specific order to avoid deadlock, the Zig equivalent would enforce resource ordering similarly. In C, we may have pthread_mutex_lock() calls that are analogous to Zig's acquire() and release() functions here. Zig's concurrency tools (std.Thread) offer a similar approach to threads and mutexes.
Key Points to Keep in Mind:

  - The main idea is to impose an order on resource acquisition.
  - Avoid circular waits by ensuring all threads follow the same resource acquisition order.
  - Check for safe states dynamically using techniques such as the Banker's Algorithm for systems with multiple resource instances.
