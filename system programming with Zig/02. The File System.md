## A file system 
is critical for managing data in a computer. 

It stores data persistently and organizes files through a directory structure, maintaining metadata related to files. 

Files in computing are logical units used to store and retrieve bytes (1s and 0s) from physical disk space. 

The UNIX philosophy that "everything is a file" is applied widely, meaning that devices, directories, and more can all be treated as files for uniformity in file operations.

### File Attributes:

Files generally have the following attributes:
- Name: Human-readable symbolic name.
- Identifier: Unique number identifying the file within the file system.
- Type: Information about the file format (e.g., executable, text).
- Location: The physical storage location (e.g., hard drive) of the file.
- Size: Current and potentially maximum size of the file.
- Protection: Access-control information, such as who owns the file and who can read/write/execute it.
- Metadata: Additional data like time, date, owner, last access time, etc.

### File Operations:

The OS allows for six basic operations on files:
- Create: Allocate space and place the file in a directory.
- Write: Add data to a file, either replacing or appending.
- Read: Retrieve data from a file into memory.
- Reposition (Seek): Move within the file to a specific location.
- Delete: Remove the file from the directory and free space.
- Truncate: Remove all contents of the file but retain the metadata.

### Example in Zig:
Here is a Zig example for opening, writing, reading, and closing a file.

#### Opening a File:
```zig
const std = @import("std");

pub fn main() void {
    var file = try std.fs.cwd().openFile("example.txt", .{ .read = true });
    defer file.close();
    std.debug.print("File opened successfully\n", .{});
}
```
#### Writing to a File:
```zig
const std = @import("std");

pub fn main() void {
    var file = try std.fs.cwd().createFile("example.txt", .{});
    defer file.close();
    try file.writeAll("Hello, Zig!\n");
}
```
#### Reading from a File:
```zig
const std = @import("std");

pub fn main() void {
    var file = try std.fs.cwd().openFile("example.txt", .{ .read = true });
    defer file.close();

    var buffer: [1024]u8 = undefined;
    const read_len = try file.readAll(&buffer);
    std.debug.print("Read {d} bytes: {s}\n", .{ read_len, buffer[0..read_len] });
}
```

## Directories:
A directory is a symbol table mapping file names to directory entries. It should support the following operations:

- Search: Find files by name or content.
- Add: Insert a file into the directory.
- Remove: Delete a file.
- List: Display files in the directory.
- Rename: Change a file's name.
- Navigate: Traverse through subdirectories.

### Navigating the File System:
The root directory in UNIX is represented by `/`. Files can be accessed by absolute paths (e.g., /bin/ls) or relative paths (e.g., ./example.txt).
```zig
const std = @import("std");

pub fn main() void {
    try std.fs.cwd().deleteFile("example.txt");
    std.debug.print("File deleted successfully\n", .{});
}
```
### Key Concepts Added:
- File Metadata: In modern systems, metadata plays a big role in security (e.g., user permissions, access time).
- File Locks: Locks can prevent race conditions where multiple processes attempt to access or modify a file simultaneously.
- Directory Tree: Directories in UNIX form a tree structure with the root / directory at the top, and subdirectories below it.
