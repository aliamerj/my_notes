# Processes 
allow multiple programs to run concurrently in modern operating systems, managed by the OS to ensure reliability. 

A process is an instance of a program in execution. 
- It is an abstraction used by the operating system to manage resources, including memory, CPU, and I/O, for the running program.
- Every process has its own address space (isolated memory) to ensure one process does not interfere with another.

## Process States:
- New: The process is being created.
- Running: Instructions are being executed on the CPU.
- Waiting (Blocked): The process is waiting for some event (like I/O completion).
- Ready: The process is ready to run but waiting for CPU availability.
- Terminated: The process has finished execution.

A process is a program in execution, which includes:
1. The program’s instructions and data.
2. The current state of the program.
3. Resources needed for execution.

## Process Control Block (PCB)
The OS manages processes using a Process Control Block (PCB), which stores essential information about a process. 

Some common fields include:
- Identifier: Unique ID for the process.
- State: Current state (running, waiting, etc.).
- Priority: The process's importance.
- Program Counter: Address of the next instruction.
- Register Data: CPU register values.
- Memory Pointers: Pointers to code/data.
- I/O Status: Info on files and devices.
- Accounting: Resource usage information.
#### When a process is suspended or interrupted, the OS saves the program counter and register data into the PCB to resume the process later.

## Process Creation and Termination:
1. **Creation**: In UNIX-like systems, new processes are created using the `fork()` system call. `fork()` creates a new process, called the child process, that is a copy of the parent process. The `exec()` system call can replace the child’s memory space with a new program.
Termination: A process terminates using the exit() system call. Upon termination, it releases resources (CPU, memory) and updates its state to Terminated.
## Process Lifecycle
Processes are created, executed, and eventually terminated. They can be created in three ways:

1. System Boot: OS starts system processes.
2. User Request: User starts a new process (e.g., running a program).
3. Process Spawning: A parent process creates a child process.
4. Processes can end in four ways:
   1. Normal Exit: Process finishes normally.
   2. Error Exit: Process voluntarily exits due to an error.
   3. Fatal Error: OS forces the process to terminate due to an error.
   4. Killed by Another Process: A process is killed by another (e.g., via the kill command).

#### Processes can become zombies (finished but waiting to be reaped) or orphans (if their parent dies before them).

## Five-State Process Model
Processes move between five possible states:

1. New: Process is created but not yet ready to run.
2. Ready: Ready to execute, but waiting for CPU time.
3. Running: Actively executing.
4. Blocked: Waiting for a resource (I/O, user input, etc.).
5. Terminated: Finished execution, but not yet cleaned up.
  
## Transitions between states include:
     1. Create: Process is created.
     2. Admit: New process becomes ready.
     3. Dispatch: Ready process starts running.
     4. Suspend: Running process is paused.
     5. Exit: Process finishes execution.
     6. Block: Running process waits for a resource.
     7. Unblock: Blocked process becomes ready.
     8. Reap: Terminated process is cleaned up.
   
## Fork Example to Zig
In Zig, you can use the `std.os.fork()` function to perform similar process forking.

```zig
const std = @import("std");

pub fn main() void {
    const pid = std.os.fork();
    if (pid == 0) {
        std.debug.print("I am the child process.\n", .{});
    } else {
        std.debug.print("I am the parent process.\n", .{});
    }
}
```
## Process Scheduling:
The scheduler determines which process gets to run on the CPU. Key concepts:
1. Preemptive Scheduling: Processes can be interrupted and moved from the running state to allow another process to run (used in most modern OSes).
2. Non-preemptive Scheduling: A process continues running until it voluntarily gives up the CPU (like during I/O waits).
3. Context Switch: When switching from one process to another, the OS performs a context switch, saving the state of the old process and loading the state of the new process.

## Process vs Thread:
A process is a heavy-weight unit with its own memory space, while a thread is a lighter-weight unit within a process that shares the same memory space. Threads within the same process can share data more easily but must handle synchronization challenges.

## Additional Information on Process Management
1. Context Switching: The OS switches between processes by saving the current state of a process in its PCB and loading the state of the next process.
2. Scheduling: The OS scheduler decides which process to run, based on priorities and resource availability.
3. Multitasking: OS manages multiple processes by switching between them rapidly to give the appearance that they are running concurrently.

# Processes in UNIX
In UNIX systems, processes can create other processes. The creator process is called the parent, while the new process is the child. This parent-child relationship continues until the root of all processes, which is typically the init process (with PID 1) or launchd in some systems.

Each process has a unique identifier called the PID (Process ID). In normal operation, users don’t often deal with PIDs, except in cases like killing a stuck process (e.g., kill -9 24601). Killing the init process is highly discouraged since it could destabilize the system.

## Process Hierarchy in UNIX
A typical UNIX system has a hierarchy of processes, forming a tree structure where the init process is at the top. Each process has its own children. A snapshot of the process tree might look like this:
```tree
init (1)
 ├── sshd (4881)
 ├── screen (7574)
 └── bash (5911)
     ├── gcc (9816)
     └── vim (9920)
```
Processes can be viewed using the `ps` command. When a user logs in, a login process is spawned, which in turn spawns a shell like bash. Commands issued in this shell, like ls or top, create new processes.

## Running Processes in the Background
Normally, when a command is issued, the shell waits for the process to finish. However, to run a command in the background, you can append an `&` to the command:

## Signals in UNIX
Signals are used in UNIX to notify processes of certain events. For example, pressing Ctrl-C sends a SIGINT (Signal 2), which typically terminates a process. Some signals include:

- SIGHUP (1): Hangup detected
- SIGKILL (9): Kill signal
- SIGTERM (15): Termination signal
- SIGCHLD (20): Child stopped or terminated

A process can handle signals using a custom handler, but SIGKILL and SIGSTOP cannot be caught or ignored.
```bash
kill -9 24601
```
This sends SIGKILL to the process with PID 24601.




Signals can be sent manually using the kill command:
