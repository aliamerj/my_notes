# Summary of Deadlock Detection & Recovery

This lecture covers deadlock detection, which involves identifying if a deadlock has occurred and, if so, recovering from it. When avoiding or preventing deadlock is not feasible due to performance or other constraints, deadlock detection becomes a practical alternative. The strategy relies on monitoring resource requests and allocations to determine if a cycle exists, signaling a deadlock.

  1. Deadlock Detection:
     - The Wait-for Graph simplifies resource allocation into a process-waiting graph, where an edge between two processes indicates that one is waiting for a resource held by the other. If a cycle is found in this graph, a deadlock exists.

     - General Deadlock Detection Algorithm: This algorithm is used when multiple instances of resources exist. It involves vectors and matrices representing resource existence, availability, allocation, and requests:
         - E (Existing Resource Vector): Total instances of each resource.
         - A (Available Resource Vector): Unallocated instances of resources.
         - C (Current Allocation Matrix): Resources assigned to each process.
         - R (Request Matrix): Resources requested by each process.
The algorithm runs iteratively to determine if any unmarked process can complete its execution with the currently available resources. If it can, the resources are released and the process is marked. If no processes can complete, deadlock is detected.
    - Assumption Algorithm: Detects deadlock by assuming that if a process takes too long, it is likely stuck in a deadlock. A watchdog timer is commonly used to declare deadlock after a certain timeout.

  2. Deadlock Recovery: Once a deadlock is detected, the system needs to recover. Various strategies can be employed:
        - Robbery (Preemption): Resources are taken from a process and given to another to break the deadlock cycle.
        - Process Termination: Involves forcefully terminating one or more processes to release their resources and resolve the deadlock. Two strategies are used:
            - Abort All Deadlocked Processes: This is drastic but ensures the deadlock is resolved.
            - Abort One Process at a Time: More gradual but may take longer to resolve the deadlock.
        - Victim Selection: Choosing which process to terminate or preempt based on criteria such as process priority, the number of resources held, and how long the process has been running.
  
## Deadlock Detection Algorithm Example in Zig

Letâ€™s implement a simplified version of the general deadlock detection algorithm in Zig. This code models a system with multiple processes and resources and checks if a deadlock exists using the method described above.

```zig
const std = @import("std");

fn vectorLessThanEqual(a: []const u32, b: []const u32) bool {
    for (a) |val, i| {
        if (val > b[i]) return false;
    }
    return true;
}

fn addVectors(a: []u32, b: []const u32) void {
    for (a) |*val, i| {
        val.* += b[i];
    }
}

pub fn detectDeadlock(C: [][]const u32, R: [][]const u32, A: []u32) bool {
    const numProcesses = C.len;
    var marked = std.mem.zeroes(bool, numProcesses); // Tracks which processes are done

    while (true) {
        var processFound = false;

        for (C) |allocations, i| {
            if (!marked[i] and vectorLessThanEqual(R[i], A)) {
                // Process can complete
                addVectors(A, allocations); // Release its resources
                marked[i] = true;
                processFound = true;
                break;
            }
        }

        if (!processFound) break; // No more processes can proceed
    }

    // If any process is unmarked, deadlock exists
    for (marked) |done| {
        if (!done) return true; // Deadlock detected
    }
    return false; // No deadlock
}

pub fn main() void {
    // Example with 3 processes and 4 resources
    var E: [4]u32 = [4, 2, 3, 1];
    var A: [4]u32 = [2, 1, 0, 0];

    var C: [][]const u32 = &[_][]const u32{
        [0, 0, 1, 0], // Allocations for process 1
        [2, 0, 0, 1], // Allocations for process 2
        [0, 1, 2, 0], // Allocations for process 3
    };

    var R: [][]const u32 = &[_][]const u32{
        [2, 0, 0, 1], // Requests for process 1
        [1, 0, 1, 0], // Requests for process 2
        [2, 1, 0, 0], // Requests for process 3
    };

    if (detectDeadlock(C, R, A)) {
        std.debug.print("Deadlock detected!\n", .{});
    } else {
        std.debug.print("No deadlock detected.\n", .{});
    }
}
```
## Key Concepts:
  1. vectorLessThanEqual checks if all resource needs of a process can be satisfied.
  2. addVectors releases a process's resources back to the available pool.
  3. detectDeadlock runs the deadlock detection algorithm based on the current allocation and request matrices, iteratively marking processes that can complete and freeing their resources.
