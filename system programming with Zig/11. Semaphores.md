# General Info About Semaphores:

A semaphore is a synchronization primitive used to control access to a shared resource in concurrent programming. It can be used to prevent race conditions, where multiple threads or processes compete to access a resource simultaneously, leading to inconsistent or incorrect results.

# Semaphores: Mutual Exclusion through Messages
Semaphores are a key synchronization primitive used to solve problems of mutual exclusion in concurrent programming. They are especially useful for coordinating access to shared resources and ensuring only one thread can access critical sections of code at a time.

The lecture begins by discussing the need for mutual exclusion, which ensures that only one thread is in the critical section at any time. It highlights some key properties of mutual exclusion, including fairness (no unnecessary waiting) and protection from indefinite delays (avoiding deadlocks).
Semaphore Overview

A semaphore is a synchronization primitive that helps achieve mutual exclusion by using signaling between threads.
  - **Binary semaphore:** Holds two possible values (0 or 1), used to signal that a resource is either available or unavailable.
    -  *This is a simplified semaphore that can only take values 0 and 1. It is essentially a lock (mutex), ensuring exclusive access to a resource.**
  - **Counting semaphore:** Holds a value larger than 1 and can be used to manage multiple instances of a resource (e.g., limiting the number of threads that access the same resource simultaneously).
    - *This allows a counter greater than 1 and is typically used to control access to a pool of resources, such as a limited number of connections or threads.**

## Semaphores have two primary operations:

  - **Wait (P):** A thread performs this operation to request entry into the critical section. If the semaphore's value is positive, the thread can proceed, decrementing the semaphore. If the value is 0, the thread is blocked.
        *Decrements the semaphore counter. If the counter is 0, the process or thread is blocked until the semaphore is available.*
  - **Post (V):** When a thread exits the critical section, it performs the post operation, incrementing the semaphore and allowing a waiting thread to proceed.
    
  - **Signal (V):** Increments the semaphore counter, potentially waking up a waiting process or thread.

## Semaphore Example in Zig

In Zig, we can use channels or other concurrency primitives to build semaphores. Here's an example of how you can implement and use a basic semaphore in Zig.

### Semaphore Structure
```zig
const std = @import("std");

pub const Semaphore = struct {
    lock_count: std.atomic.AtomicI32,

    pub fn init(self: *Semaphore, initial_value: i32) void {
        self.lock_count.store(initial_value, .SeqCst);
    }

    pub fn wait(self: *Semaphore) void {
        while (self.lock_count.fetch_sub(1, .SeqCst) <= 0) {
            self.lock_count.fetch_add(1, .SeqCst); // Restore count and wait
            std.time.sleep(10 * std.time.ns_per_ms); // Busy wait with sleep
        }
    }

    pub fn post(self: *Semaphore) void {
        self.lock_count.fetch_add(1, .SeqCst);
    }
};
```
### Example Usage
The following demonstrates a simple scenario where two threads use a semaphore to synchronize access to a critical section:
```zig
const std = @import("std");
const Semaphore = @import("semaphore").Semaphore;

pub fn main() !void {
    var sem = Semaphore{};
    sem.init(1); // Binary semaphore initialized to 1

    var t1 = try std.Thread.spawn({}, wait_task, &sem);
    var t2 = try std.Thread.spawn({}, post_task, &sem);

    t1.join();
    t2.join();
}

fn wait_task(sem: *Semaphore) void {
    sem.wait();
    std.debug.print("Thread 1: Entering critical section\n", .{});
    std.time.sleep(1 * std.time.ns_per_s); // Simulate some work
    std.debug.print("Thread 1: Leaving critical section\n", .{});
    sem.post();
}

fn post_task(sem: *Semaphore) void {
    sem.wait();
    std.debug.print("Thread 2: Entering critical section\n", .{});
    std.time.sleep(500 * std.time.ns_per_ms); // Simulate some work
    std.debug.print("Thread 2: Leaving critical section\n", .{});
    sem.post();
}
```
### Key Concepts Explained

  - **Mutual Exclusion:** The semaphore ensures that only one thread can access the critical section by blocking others when the semaphore count is 0.
  
  - **Fairness:** Semaphore implementations generally allow threads to proceed in the order they request access, preventing indefinite delays.
  
  - **Avoiding Busy Waiting:** Semaphores avoid the need for busy waiting by blocking threads until the critical section becomes available, instead of continuously polling (e.g., the sleep in the wait function introduces a small wait time to avoid busy loops).

### C to Zig Translation

Although we didn't include the C code, the Zig example demonstrates how similar logic can be implemented in Zig, using atomic operations (AtomicI32) to ensure safe concurrent modifications to the semaphore's count.

The wait and post functions mimic the behavior of their C counterparts, where wait decrements the semaphore and blocks if necessary, while post signals that the critical section has been exited, allowing another thread to enter.

The Zig implementation adds std.time.sleep to avoid busy waiting, an improvement over pure busy waiting that can waste CPU resources.

### Semaphores in Linux:
In Linux, semaphores can be used for process synchronization or inter-process communication (IPC). There are two main types of semaphores in Linux:
POSIX Semaphores (sem_t): Used for thread and process synchronization. They are initialized with sem_init() (for in-process usage) or sem_open() (for named semaphores used between processes).
    System V Semaphores (semget()): Used for process synchronization in System V IPC.

### Semaphores in Linux:
In Linux, semaphores can be used for process synchronization or inter-process communication (IPC). There are two main types of semaphores in Linux:

1. POSIX Semaphores (sem_t): Used for thread and process synchronization. They are initialized with sem_init() (for in-process usage) or sem_open() (for named semaphores used between processes).
2. System V Semaphores (semget()): Used for process synchronization in System V IPC.

### POSIX Semaphore API:
1. `sem_init(sem_t *sem, int pshared, unsigned int value)`: Initializes a semaphore. pshared determines whether the semaphore is shared between threads (0) or processes (non-zero).
2. `sem_wait(sem_t *sem)`: Performs the "P" (wait) operation. If the semaphore value is 0, it blocks the thread.
3. `sem_post(sem_t *sem)`: Performs the "V" (signal) operation. It increments the semaphore and unblocks any waiting threads.
4. `sem_destroy(sem_t *sem)`: Cleans up a semaphore.

### Example in C (POSIX Semaphores):
```c
#include <semaphore.h>
#include <pthread.h>
#include <stdio.h>

sem_t sem;

void* thread_func(void* arg) {
    sem_wait(&sem);  // Wait (P operation)
    printf("Thread %ld entered critical section\n", (long)arg);
    sem_post(&sem);  // Signal (V operation)
    return NULL;
}

int main() {
    pthread_t threads[2];
    sem_init(&sem, 0, 1);  // Initialize semaphore with value 1 (binary semaphore)

    pthread_create(&threads[0], NULL, thread_func, (void*)1);
    pthread_create(&threads[1], NULL, thread_func, (void*)2);

    pthread_join(threads[0], NULL);
    pthread_join(threads[1], NULL);
    sem_destroy(&sem);  // Cleanup

    return 0;
}
```
### Semaphores in Zig:
While Zig doesn't have a built-in semaphore type, you can implement one using its concurrency primitives such as channels, mutexes, or using low-level system calls.

#### Using Zig Channels as a Semaphore:
Zig's std.Thread.Channel can be used to build a counting semaphore-like mechanism, where threads send signals through a channel to allow access to critical sections. However, this is more suitable for task queues than classic semaphores.

#### Implementing a Binary Semaphore in Zig (Simple Example):
```zig
const std = @import("std");

const Semaphore = struct {
    mutex: std.Thread.Mutex,
    cond: std.Thread.Cond,
    count: usize,
    max_count: usize,

    pub fn init(self: *Semaphore, max_count: usize) void {
        self.mutex.init();
        self.cond.init();
        self.count = max_count;
        self.max_count = max_count;
    }

    pub fn wait(self: *Semaphore) void {
        self.mutex.lock();
        while (self.count == 0) {
            self.cond.wait(&self.mutex);
        }
        self.count -= 1;
        self.mutex.unlock();
    }

    pub fn signal(self: *Semaphore) void {
        self.mutex.lock();
        if (self.count < self.max_count) {
            self.count += 1;
            self.cond.signal();
        }
        self.mutex.unlock();
    }
};

pub fn main() void {
    var semaphore = Semaphore.init(1); // Binary semaphore

    std.debug.print("Waiting on semaphore...\n", .{});
    semaphore.wait();
    std.debug.print("Semaphore acquired!\n", .{});
    semaphore.signal();
}
```
In this example, the binary semaphore is implemented using Zig's std.Thread.Mutex and std.Thread.Cond (a condition variable) to control access to a resource.
### Key Steps:
  1. Initialization: The Semaphore is initialized with a maximum count (for binary, it's usually 1).
  2. Wait (P): The thread blocks if the count is 0 and waits on the condition variable.
  3. Signal (V): The semaphore count is incremented, and any waiting threads are signaled.

### Use Cases:
  1. Resource Management: Limiting access to a limited number of resources, like database connections.
  2. Task Synchronization: Ensuring that only a certain number of threads perform a task concurrently.

### Common Pitfalls:
  1. Deadlock: If all threads block on sem_wait(), and no thread is left to signal the semaphore, the system can deadlock.
  2. Priority Inversion: Higher-priority tasks may get blocked by lower-priority tasks if not managed properly.
