# Summary of the Readers-Writers Problem
The Readers-Writers Problem focuses on managing concurrent access to a shared data structure by multiple threads, where some threads only read data, while others modify it. Unlike the Producer-Consumer Problem, some concurrency is allowed for readers. The challenge is to ensure that:

  1. Multiple readers can access the critical section simultaneously.
  2. Only one writer can access the critical section, and no readers can be present while a writer is writing.

This problem is commonly encountered in file systems, where multiple threads may read a file, but only one can write at a time, and no thread may read during writing to prevent inconsistency.
## Key Concepts:

  - Critical Section: The part of the code where shared data is accessed or modified.
  - Readers: Threads that read data without modifying it.
  - Writers: Threads that modify the data.
  - Starvation: Occurs when a writer waits indefinitely because new readers keep arriving, preventing the writer from entering the critical section.
  - Deadlock: A situation where two or more threads are blocked forever, waiting for each other.

## Key Synchronization Tools:

  - Semaphores: Used to manage access to the critical section.
      - mutex: Ensures mutual exclusion when modifying the number of readers.
      - roomEmpty: Ensures only one writer or multiple readers can access the critical section.
      - turnstile: Introduced to prevent readers from starving writers.

## Solutions:

  1. Basic Solution (Risk of starvation):
     - Writers must wait until the room is empty before entering.
     - Readers can enter if no writers are waiting, and the first reader locks the room to prevent writers.
     - Once the last reader leaves, it unlocks the room for writers.

  2. Improved Solution (Prevents starvation):
     - Introduces a turnstile semaphore. When a writer arrives, it locks the turnstile, preventing new readers from entering. Current readers finish, then the writer writes.

  3. Writer Priority (Writers have priority, risk of reader starvation):
     - Separates roomEmpty into noReaders and noWriters semaphores.
     - Writers must wait for both noWriters and noReaders to be available, and readers only wait for noWriters.

## Example in Zig
Hereâ€™s an example of how you could implement the Readers-Writers Problem using semaphores and mutexes in Zig.

```zig
const std = @import("std");

var readers: i32 = 0;
var writers: i32 = 0;
var mutex: std.Thread.Mutex = std.Thread.Mutex.init();
var roomEmpty: std.Thread.Semaphore = std.Thread.Semaphore.init(1);
var turnstile: std.Thread.Semaphore = std.Thread.Semaphore.init(1);
var writeMutex: std.Thread.Mutex = std.Thread.Mutex.init();

// Writer function
fn writer_thread() !void {
    try turnstile.wait(); // Wait for the turnstile
    try roomEmpty.wait(); // Wait for room to be empty

    // Critical section: Writing data
    std.debug.print("Writer is writing data\n", .{});
    
    // Release resources
    roomEmpty.post();
    turnstile.post(); 
}

// Reader function
fn reader_thread() !void {
    try turnstile.wait(); // Wait for the turnstile
    turnstile.post(); // Release immediately so other readers can enter

    try mutex.lock();
    readers += 1;
    if (readers == 1) {
        // First reader locks room for readers
        try roomEmpty.wait();
    }
    mutex.unlock();

    // Critical section: Reading data
    std.debug.print("Reader is reading data\n", .{});

    try mutex.lock();
    readers -= 1;
    if (readers == 0) {
        // Last reader releases the room
        roomEmpty.post();
    }
    mutex.unlock();
}

// Main function to start reader and writer threads
pub fn main() !void {
    const thread = std.Thread;

    // Create writer threads
    const writer1 = try thread.spawn(writer_thread, .{});
    const writer2 = try thread.spawn(writer_thread, .{});

    // Create reader threads
    const reader1 = try thread.spawn(reader_thread, .{});
    const reader2 = try thread.spawn(reader_thread, .{});

    // Wait for all threads to complete
    try writer1.join();
    try writer2.join();
    try reader1.join();
    try reader2.join();
}
```
### Key Changes from C to Zig:

  - pthread_mutex_t is replaced by std.Thread.Mutex in Zig.
  - pthread_rwlock_t is not directly needed, as Zig's thread synchronization uses basic semaphores and mutexes, simplifying the implementation.
  - Zig's std.Thread.Semaphore serves as the equivalent to C semaphores.

### Explanation of the Zig Code:

  - The writer_thread function waits for both the turnstile and roomEmpty semaphores to ensure no new readers or writers can enter before it writes.
  - The reader_thread function increments the reader count and waits for the first reader to lock the room. After reading, it decrements the count and unlocks the room if it's the last reader.
