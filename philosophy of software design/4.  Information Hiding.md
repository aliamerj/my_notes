# Information Hiding
The key to building deep (useful and well-structured) modules is information hiding. This means that a module should keep certain details private and only expose a simple, high-level interface to other parts of the system.

## For example:
- A database module hides how data is stored in a B-tree.
- A file system module hides how disk blocks are mapped to files.
- A networking module hides the inner workings of the TCP protocol.

#### By hiding implementation details, a module becomes easier to use and more flexible to change. If we ever need to change how something works internally (e.g., optimizing a data structure), other parts of the system wonâ€™t break because they donâ€™t rely on those hidden details.

#### However, just marking class variables as private isnâ€™t enough. If getters and setters expose them, the information is still leaked! True information hiding means that other parts of the system donâ€™t even need to know that information exists.

## Information Leakage
The opposite of information hiding is information leakage, which happens when multiple parts of a system depend on the same knowledge. This causes tight coupling, meaning that if one part changes, others must also change.

## For example:
- If both a file reader and a file writer understand the same file format, a change in the format requires updating both.
- If two modules share knowledge about how data is stored in memory, updating that storage method means changing both.
- Information leakage makes software harder to maintain and more error-prone.

### ðŸ’¡ Solution: If two or more modules depend on the same piece of knowledge, consider moving that knowledge into a single module to avoid duplication.

## Temporal Decomposition (A Common Mistake)
A common cause of information leakage is designing software based on execution order (temporal decomposition).

## Example:

- A team designing an HTTP server split the process into two classes: one that reads HTTP requests and another that parses them.
- This caused duplication because some parsing (like reading headers) was needed just to know how much data to read.
- A better approach would have been one class that handles both reading and parsing, so that all HTTP-related knowledge is kept in a single place.

Instead of splitting code by when things happen, we should structure it based on what knowledge each module needs.

### Case Study: HTTP Server
Students building an HTTP server made two key mistakes:

1. Too many small classes â€“ Instead of merging related responsibilities, they split them too much, leading to information leakage.
2. Exposing internal data structures â€“ They returned a raw Map<String, String> of parameters instead of providing a method like getParameter("photo_id"), which would have hidden internal implementation details.

### ðŸ’¡ Lesson: Sometimes making a class slightly bigger improves information hiding. If related knowledge is spread across multiple small classes, it may be better to merge them.

#### Key Takeaways
- âœ… Hide implementation details â€“ Only expose whatâ€™s necessary.
- âœ… Avoid leaking knowledge across multiple modules.
- âœ… Donâ€™t split code just because things happen in a sequence â€“ Instead, focus on grouping related knowledge.
- âœ… Think carefully about interfaces â€“ A deeper, more abstract interface is better than exposing internal data structures.

By following these principles, we can build simpler, more maintainable, and more flexible software.
