# Different Layer, Different Abstraction
This chapter emphasizes the importance of distinct abstractions at different layers in a software system. When layers have similar responsibilities, it often leads to unnecessary complexity, poor design, and maintenance challenges.

## 1. Layers Should Provide Different Abstractions
A well-structured system has multiple layers where each layer has a distinct role:

- File Systems: The top layer handles files as variable-length byte arrays, the middle layer caches disk blocks in memory, and the bottom layer moves data between disk and memory.
- TCP Protocol: The top layer deals with reliable byte streams, while the lower layer handles unreliable packet transmission.

If adjacent layers have similar abstractions, it’s a sign of poor design.

## 2. Pass-Through Methods: A Red Flag
A pass-through method is a method that does nothing except call another method with the same signature. This often signals overlapping responsibilities between classes.

### Example: A poorly designed text editor

```java
public class TextDocument {
    private TextArea textArea;

    public int getCursorOffset() {
        return textArea.getCursorOffset(); // Pass-through
    }

    public void insertString(String text, int offset) {
        textArea.insertString(text, offset); // Pass-through
    }
}
```
Here, TextDocument just forwards method calls to TextArea without adding real functionality. This increases interface complexity without adding value.

#### How to fix it?

- Expose the lower-level class directly.
- Redistribute responsibilities properly.
- Merge classes if needed.

## 3. When Is API Duplication Acceptable?
Not all duplicated method signatures are bad. Some valid cases include:

- Dispatchers: A function selects and calls different methods dynamically.
- Interfaces with multiple implementations: Example: different disk drivers implementing the same API.
- The key rule: Each method should contribute new functionality.

## 4. The Problem with the Decorator Pattern
Decorators (wrappers) add extra functionality by calling methods on an underlying object. Example: BufferedInputStream wraps an InputStream to add buffering.

## Issues with excessive decorators:
- Creates too many shallow classes.
- Adds unnecessary pass-through methods.
### Alternatives:
- Add the new feature directly to the original class.
- Merge decorators where possible.
- Consider making the feature a separate class instead of a wrapper.

### 5. Interface vs. Implementation
A good class design should have an interface that is different from its internal implementation.

#### Bad Example (Shallow Class):

- A text editor stores text in lines and exposes only getLine() and putLine().
- This forces higher layers to manually split and join lines when inserting/deleting text.

#### Better Design:

- Provide methods like insertText(offset, text) and deleteRange(start, end).
- This hides complexity from upper layers and makes the class deeper.

### 6. Pass-Through Variables: Another Anti-Pattern
A pass-through variable is a variable passed through multiple layers even though most layers don’t need it.

### Example:

```java
void main() {
    processRequest(cert);
}

void processRequest(Certificate cert) {
    authenticateUser(cert);
}

void authenticateUser(Certificate cert) {
    establishSecureConnection(cert);  // Only this method really needs it!
}
```
This forces unnecessary dependencies.

#### Solutions:

- Use a shared object (e.g., a NetworkConfig object that holds the certificate).
- Use a global variable (but be cautious—this limits multiple instances).
- Use a context object to store global state (most flexible solution).

## Final Thoughts
- Different layers should have different abstractions—avoid redundancy.
- Pass-through methods and pass-through variables signal poor design—eliminate them by restructuring.
- Use dispatchers and interfaces wisely, ensuring each method adds real value.
- Be careful with decorators—don’t overuse them.
- Keep your interface distinct from implementation to encapsulate complexity.
