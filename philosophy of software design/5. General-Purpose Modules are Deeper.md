# General-Purpose Modules are Deeper
- When designing a new module, a common question arises: should it be general-purpose (flexible for multiple future uses) or special-purpose (tailored to the specific needs of today)?

- Some developers advocate for general-purpose modules because they can be reused in ways that were not initially anticipated, saving time later. Others argue that predicting future needs is difficult, and it's better to focus on current requirements and refactor later if needed.

## 1. Make Classes "Somewhat" General-Purpose
Instead of going fully general or fully specialized, the best approach is a "somewhat general-purpose" design. This means:
- The module should be built for today's needs, but
- Its interface should be broad enough to allow for future flexibility.

This results in simpler and deeper interfaces—ones that require fewer methods while remaining powerful.

## 2. Example: Storing Text in a Text Editor
In a software design class, students built text editors with multiple views and undo/redo functionality. Most teams created a specialized API, adding methods like:

```cpp
void backspace(Cursor cursor);
void delete(Cursor cursor);
void deleteSelection(Selection selection);
```
However, this approach made the text class too tightly connected to the user interface, forcing UI developers to learn many shallow methods and creating unnecessary complexity.

## 3. A More General-Purpose API
A better approach is to design a text class with only fundamental text operations:

```cpp
void insert(Position position, String newText);
void delete(Position start, Position end);
Position changePosition(Position position, int numChars);
```
Now, backspace can be implemented in the UI like this:

```cpp
text.delete(text.changePosition(cursor, -1), cursor);
```
And delete like this:

```cpp
text.delete(cursor, text.changePosition(cursor, 1));
```
This approach has fewer methods, but they are deeper and more flexible. It also allows the text class to be used for other applications (e.g., search-and-replace tools) without modification.

## 4. Generality Leads to Better Information Hiding
- General-purpose APIs separate concerns better: the text class doesn't need to know about UI details like how backspace is handled.
- Developers don’t need to learn many methods, reducing cognitive load.
- False abstractions (like a backspace() method) should be avoided if they just obscure critical information rather than genuinely hiding complexity.

## 5. Questions to Ask When Designing APIs
To find the right balance between general-purpose and special-purpose:

- What’s the simplest interface that covers all needs? Reduce unnecessary methods while keeping the API simple.
- How often will each method be used? If a method is for one specific case, consider making it more general.
- Is the API easy to use for current needs? If too much extra code is needed to perform common tasks, it may be too general and should be adjusted.

## 6. Conclusion
General-purpose interfaces tend to be:
- ✅ Simpler (fewer, deeper methods)
- ✅ More reusable
- ✅ Better at separating concerns
- ✅ Easier to maintain
