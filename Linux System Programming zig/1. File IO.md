# File I/O in Unix (in Zig)
File I/O is an essential part of interacting with a Unix system, as many components in Unix are treated as files, such as devices, pipes, and sockets. In this section, we'll go over the basic system calls for file operations in Unix, focusing on the Zig programming language.

## Concepts of File Descriptors

A file descriptor is an integer that the kernel uses to keep track of open files. Each process has a table of file descriptors, and the kernel manages the state and access permissions for each open file. File descriptors are nonnegative integers, and in Unix, every process starts with at least three standard file descriptors:

  1. `0` (stdin): Standard input
  2. `1` (stdout): Standard output
  3. `2` (stderr): Standard error

In Zig, file descriptors are used similarly, and Zig’s standard library provides abstractions over system calls like open, close, read, and write to work with files.

## Opening Files in Zig

Before interacting with a file, it must first be opened. The Zig standard library provides a simple way to open a file:
```zig
const std = @import("std");

pub fn main() !void {
    // Open a file for reading
    var file = try std.fs.cwd().openFile("test.txt", .{ .read = true });

    // Do something with the file (e.g., read, write)
    
    // Always close the file when done
    try file.close();
}
```
Here, openFile takes a path to the file and a struct that specifies the desired access mode. In this case, .read = true opens the file in read-only mode.
System Call open in Unix (Equivalent in Zig)

The Unix open system call allows a file to be opened and associated with a file descriptor. In Zig, we use the std.fs module to open files, which abstracts this system call. Let's look at the Unix concept first:

In Unix, the open system call works like this:

```c
int open(const char *name, int flags);
```

It takes the file's name and a set of flags to specify how the file should be opened. Flags can include:
- O_RDONLY: Open for reading
- O_WRONLY: Open for writing
- O_RDWR: Open for both reading and writing

For example:
```c
int fd = open("/home/user/file.txt", O_RDONLY);
```
In Zig, the same can be achieved using the openFile method:
```zig
const std = @import("std");

pub fn main() !void {
    var file = try std.fs.cwd().openFile("test.txt", .{ .read = true });
    defer file.close();
}
```
Zig handles file opening and flag manipulation internally, so you don't need to directly manage file descriptors unless working at a lower level.
Closing Files in Zig

Once you're done with a file, you must close it to free the file descriptor. In Zig, you simply call the close method on the File object:
```zig
try file.close();
```
This ensures that system resources are released properly, similar to the Unix close system call.

### File Permissions in Zig

When creating new files, you may need to specify the file's permissions. Unix uses a bitset for file permissions (e.g., 0644), which defines the owner, group, and others' access to the file. In Zig, you can specify permissions when creating a file using openFile.

For example, if you wanted to create a file with read/write permissions for the owner and read-only permissions for others, you'd do something like this:
```zig
const std = @import("std");

pub fn main() !void {
    const mode = std.os.FileFlags{ .read = true, .write = true };
    var file = try std.fs.cwd().createFile("newfile.txt", mode, 0644);
    defer file.close();
}
```
Here, 0644 represents the permissions, where the owner can read and write, but others can only read.

### File Operations: Read/Write in Zig

Once a file is opened, you can read from or write to it using system calls. In Zig, you would use the read or write methods on the File object to perform these actions.

For example, to read from a file:
```zig
const std = @import("std");

pub fn main() !void {
    var file = try std.fs.cwd().openFile("test.txt", .{ .read = true });
    defer file.close();

    var buffer: [1024]u8 = undefined;
    const read_bytes = try file.read(buffer[0..]);
    std.debug.print("Read {} bytes: {}\n", .{read_bytes, buffer[0..read_bytes]});
}
```
This example reads the contents of test.txt into a buffer and prints the number of bytes read.
### Summary

This first section of file I/O covered the basic concepts of interacting with files in Unix and how to apply them using Zig. We went over file descriptors, how to open and close files, and how to perform basic read and write operations. The goal is to get comfortable working with files, which is foundational for more advanced topics like asynchronous I/O, direct I/O, and file manipulation.

## Reading via read() in Zig
In Zig, just like in C, file I/O involves system calls such as read() to handle reading data from file descriptors. This system call reads data from a file (or another input resource) into a buffer. However, understanding how to handle read() effectively is crucial to avoid common pitfalls like partial reads, signals, and blocking issues.

Here is an explanation of how we can implement read() behavior in Zig, covering both blocking and non-blocking reads, as well as handling the associated error codes.

### read() System Call in Zig

The read() system call reads up to a specified number of bytes (len) into a buffer from a file descriptor (fd). In Zig, we typically use std.fs.File.read() or interact with lower-level system calls for POSIX-like behavior.
### Key Concepts and Handling Errors

  1. Partial Reads: The read() function can return fewer bytes than requested, so we need a loop to ensure all the data is read.
  2. End of File (EOF): When the read() function returns 0, it means we’ve reached EOF.
  3. Signal Interruptions: If read() is interrupted by a signal, it returns -1 and sets the error code to EINTR. We can simply reattempt the read() call.
  4. Non-blocking Reads: If no data is available, the read() call returns -1 and sets the error to EAGAIN. Non-blocking mode allows the application to perform other tasks while waiting for data.
     
### Basic Example of read() in Zig

Here’s how we can implement a file reading function in Zig, managing partial reads and handling errors properly:
```zig
const std = @import("std");

fn readAll(fd: std.fs.File, buf: []u8) !usize {
    var len: usize = buf.len;
    var bytes_read: usize = 0;

    while (len != 0) {
        const result = try fd.read(&buf[bytes_read..]);

        // Check for EOF, as read() returns 0 when it reaches the end of the file
        if (result == 0) {
            break; // End of file reached
        }

        bytes_read += result;
        len -= result;
    }

    return bytes_read;
}

pub fn main() void {
    const stdout = std.io.getStdOut().writer();
    var file = std.fs.cwd().openFile("example.txt", .{}) catch unreachable;

    var buf: [1024]u8 = undefined;
    const bytes_read = readAll(file, &buf) catch {
        stdout.print("Error reading file\n", .{}) catch unreachable;
        return;
    };

    stdout.print("Read {} bytes: {s}\n", .{bytes_read, buf[0..bytes_read]}) catch unreachable;
}
```
### Explanation of Code:

  1. Function readAll: This function continuously reads from the file descriptor fd into the buffer buf. It keeps track of how many bytes are read and ensures that it reads all the requested data (unless EOF is reached or an error occurs).
     - The loop checks the result of each read call, handling partial reads by updating len and adjusting the buffer pointer to continue reading where it left off.
     - If read() returns 0, it means we've reached EOF, so the loop breaks.

  2. Handling EOF: The return value of 0 indicates EOF, and we use this to terminate the loop when there is no more data to read.
  3. Handling Partial Reads: Each iteration reads as much data as available and adjusts the remaining length (len) to ensure that all requested data is eventually read.
  4. Error Handling: If an error occurs during read(), the code returns an error using Zig's try and error propagation.

### Non-Blocking Reads

For non-blocking I/O, we can open the file descriptor in non-blocking mode. In Zig, the std.fs.File struct provides methods that can work in both blocking and non-blocking modes.

To implement non-blocking I/O, we modify the file opening call and check for the specific EAGAIN error:
```zig
fn readNonBlocking(fd: std.fs.File, buf: []u8) !usize {
    var bytes_read: usize = 0;
    var result: usize = 0;
    
    while (true) {
        result = fd.read(&buf[bytes_read..]) catch |err| switch (err) {
            error.EAGAIN => return bytes_read, // No data available yet, exit
            else => return err,
        };

        if (result == 0) {
            break; // EOF reached
        }

        bytes_read += result;
    }

    return bytes_read;
}

pub fn main() void {
    const stdout = std.io.getStdOut().writer();
    var file = std.fs.cwd().openFile("example.txt", .{ .non_blocking = true }) catch unreachable;

    var buf: [1024]u8 = undefined;
    const bytes_read = readNonBlocking(file, &buf) catch {
        stdout.print("Error reading file\n", .{}) catch unreachable;
        return;
    };

    stdout.print("Read {} bytes (non-blocking): {s}\n", .{bytes_read, buf[0..bytes_read]}) catch unreachable;
}
```
### Explanation of Code:
  1. Non-blocking Mode: The file is opened in non-blocking mode by passing the .{ .non_blocking = true } flag.
  2. Handling EAGAIN: When there is no data available, the EAGAIN error is handled, and the function exits without blocking the execution.

This pattern is common for handling asynchronous file or socket reads, where you may need to perform other tasks while waiting for data to become available.

## Writing with write() in Zig

The write() system call in POSIX behaves similarly to read(), except that it writes data to a file or another output resource. Just as with reading, partial writes can occur, and we need to handle this in a loop.

Here’s how we can perform safe and complete writes in Zig:
```zig
fn writeAll(fd: std.fs.File, buf: []const u8) !void {
    var len: usize = buf.len;
    var bytes_written: usize = 0;

    while (len != 0) {
        const result = try fd.write(&buf[bytes_written..]);

        bytes_written += result;
        len -= result;
    }
}

pub fn main() void {
    const stdout = std.io.getStdOut().writer();
    var file = std.fs.cwd().openFile("output.txt", .{ .write = true, .create = true }) catch unreachable;

    const buf = "Hello, Zig!";
    writeAll(file, buf) catch {
        stdout.print("Error writing to file\n", .{}) catch unreachable;
        return;
    };

    stdout.print("Data written successfully\n", .{}) catch unreachable;
}
```
#### Explanation:

  1. Function writeAll: Ensures that the entire buffer is written by looping until all data is written.
  2. Partial Writes: If only part of the data is written (which can happen with non-regular files like sockets), the loop continues writing the remaining data.
  3. Error Handling: Any write errors are propagated with try.

This approach handles both partial writes and common errors, ensuring that all the data gets written correctly.

#### Conclusion
By implementing file I/O using Zig’s low-level capabilities, we handle common challenges like partial reads, non-blocking operations, and proper error handling. These patterns allow you to write robust and efficient I/O code that works in various scenarios, from reading files to handling network connections.

## Synchronized I/O in Zig

In this section, we discuss the concepts of synchronized I/O using various system calls such as fsync(), fdatasync(), sync(), and the use of flags like O_SYNC, O_DSYNC, and O_RSYNC. These system calls and flags allow applications to control when data is written to disk, providing guarantees of data consistency while trading off performance for synchronization.

### Concepts of Synchronized I/O

Synchronized I/O refers to the practice of ensuring that the data written to disk is fully committed and made persistent. Typically, operating systems implement write buffering to improve performance by delaying writes to disk. However, there are scenarios where applications require guarantees that data has been written to disk, and for such cases, Linux provides system calls like fsync() and fdatasync().

### Buffered vs Synchronized I/O

  1. Buffered Writes: By default, writes to files are buffered. The operating system caches the data and writes it to disk asynchronously, which is faster but does not guarantee immediate persistence on disk.
  2. Synchronized Writes: For critical operations, applications need guarantees that data is safely written to disk. This is where system calls like fsync() and fdatasync() come into play.

### fsync() and fdatasync()

Both functions provide a way to flush data to disk, but they differ in what they guarantee:
  1. fsync(): Ensures that both the file's data and metadata (e.g., timestamps, permissions) are written to disk. This involves at least two I/O operations: one for data and another for metadata (inode update).
  2. fdatasync(): Flushes only the data and essential metadata needed to access the file (such as its size), excluding non-essential metadata like modification timestamps. This can provide a performance benefit compared to fsync().
```zig
const std = @import("std");

fn handle_fsync(fd: i32) !void {
    var ret: i32 = std.os.fsync(fd);
    if (ret == -1) {
        std.debug.print("Error: {}\n", .{std.os.lasterrormsg()});
        return error.FsyncFailed;
    }
}

fn handle_fdatasync(fd: i32) !void {
    var ret: i32 = std.os.fdatasync(fd);
    if (ret == -1) {
        std.debug.print("Error: {}\n", .{std.os.lasterrormsg()});
        return error.FdatasyncFailed;
    }
}
```
### Error Handling in fsync() and fdatasync()

Both fsync() and fdatasync() return 0 on success and -1 on failure. They can fail for several reasons, such as:

  - EBADF: The file descriptor is invalid or not open for writing.
  - EINVAL: The file descriptor points to an object that does not support synchronization.
  - EIO: An I/O error occurred while syncing.

In some cases, fsync() may not be implemented by the filesystem, so a fallback to fdatasync() is recommended when fsync() returns EINVAL.
sync()

The sync() system call synchronizes all file system buffers across the system, but it does not wait for the buffers to be fully committed to disk. Its primary use is in system-level utilities that need to ensure that all file system data is flushed to disk.

In Zig, you can invoke sync() as follows:
```zig
fn handle_sync() void {
    std.os.sync();
}

```

### The O_SYNC Flag

When opening a file, the O_SYNC flag can be used to force synchronized I/O, meaning that every write to the file will block until the data is written to disk. This can be useful for ensuring data integrity, but it comes with a significant performance penalty.

In Zig, you would open a file with O_SYNC like this:

```zig
const std = @import("std");

fn open_sync_file(path: []const u8) !std.fs.File {
    const file = try std.fs.cwd().openFile(path, .{ .write = true, .sync = true });
    return file;
}
```

In this case, Zig provides a higher-level API through the std.fs library, where the sync flag can be passed when opening a file.
Direct I/O with O_DIRECT

For applications that require minimal operating system intervention, the O_DIRECT flag can be used when opening files. This flag bypasses the kernel’s page cache and directly transfers data between user-space buffers and the device. However, this approach requires strict alignment of data (e.g., buffer size, file offsets) to the underlying device’s sector size, which is typically 512 bytes.

In Zig, using O_DIRECT would look like this:

```zig
const std = @import("std");

fn open_direct_file(path: []const u8) !std.fs.File {
    const file = try std.fs.cwd().openFile(path, .{ .write = true, .direct = true });
    return file;
}
```

### Closing Files

After completing file operations, it is important to close the file descriptors to release system resources. In Zig, you close a file using the std.fs.File.close() method.

```zig

fn close_file(file: std.fs.File) !void {
    try file.close();
}
```

Closing a file ensures that resources are released, but it does not guarantee that data is flushed to disk. For critical data, make sure to call fsync() or fdatasync() before closing the file.
Summary

  1. fsync() and fdatasync() are used to ensure that file data is written to disk. fsync() flushes both data and metadata, while fdatasync() focuses on data and essential metadata for faster performance.
  2. sync() flushes all file system buffers to disk, but does not wait for the process to complete.
  3. O_SYNC forces every write operation to synchronize the data with the disk immediately, at the cost of performance.
  4. O_DIRECT bypasses the kernel's caching mechanisms and transfers data directly between user-space and the device, which is useful for applications that implement their own caching strategies.
