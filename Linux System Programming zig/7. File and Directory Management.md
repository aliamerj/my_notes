## What is Metadata?
Metadata is data about a file that describes its properties, but it doesn't include the file's actual content. For example:
- Size of the file (in bytes)
- File type (e.g., regular file, directory, or symbolic link)
- Access permissions (e.g., readable, writable, executable)
- Owner and group IDs (to track who owns the file)
- Last modified or accessed time (timestamps)
Think of metadata as a file's profile information that tells you everything about the file, except what's inside it.

## Inodes
Every file on a Unix-like filesystem is associated with an inode (short for "index node").
- An inode is a data structure on disk and in memory.
- It contains metadata about the file (like permissions, size, owner).
- It doesn't store the file's name. Instead, the file name is stored in the directory entry, which links to the inode.
Each file has a unique inode number within its filesystem. For example:

```bash
$ ls -i
12345 example.txt
```
The number 12345 is the inode number.

## How to Work with Metadata in Linux
To access metadata, Unix provides a set of system calls:
- stat: Fetches metadata for a file specified by its path.
- fstat: Fetches metadata for a file represented by a file descriptor.
- lstat: Similar to stat, but works on symbolic links themselves instead of their targets.

### Implementing stat in Zig
Here's how to use stat to get metadata for a file in Zig:

Code Example: Fetching File Metadata
```zig
const std = @import("std");

pub fn main() !void {
    const allocator = std.heap.page_allocator;

    // File path to analyze
    const file_path = "example.txt";

    var stat_buf: std.fs.Stat = undefined;

    // Open the file
    const file = try std.fs.cwd().openFile(file_path, .{ .read = true });
    defer file.close();

    // Fetch the metadata
    stat_buf = try file.getStat();

    // Print file size
    std.debug.print("File: {s}\n", .{file_path});
    std.debug.print("Size: {d} bytes\n", .{stat_buf.size});
    std.debug.print("Last Access Time: {s}\n", .{stat_buf.atime.toString()});
    std.debug.print("Last Modification Time: {s}\n", .{stat_buf.mtime.toString()});
    std.debug.print("Permissions: {s}\n", .{stat_buf.mode.toString()});
}
```

##### Explanation:
1. Inode Access in Zig: The std.fs.Stat struct gives access to all metadata:
   - size: File size in bytes.
   - atime: Last accessed time.
   - mtime: Last modified time.
   - mode: Access permissions.
2. File Opening:
- We open the file using std.fs.cwd().openFile() to get a handle.

3. Fetching Metadata:
- Call file.getStat() to fetch the metadata and populate the std.fs.Stat structure.
4. Output:
- The code prints the metadata (e.g., size, timestamps, and permissions).

### Hard and Symbolic Links in Linux Filesystems
#### Concept 1: What are Hard Links?
A hard link is a direct pointer to the same inode as the original file. It effectively creates another name for the same file.

#### Key points:
- Both the original file and the hard link share the same inode number.
- Changes to the file content will be reflected in all hard links pointing to it because they reference the same data blocks.
- Deleting one hard link does not remove the file data as long as there’s at least one link remaining.
- Hard links cannot span across filesystems because they rely on inode numbers, which are unique only within a single filesystem.
Example:
In the terminal:
```bash
$ echo "Hello World" > original.txt
$ ln original.txt hardlink.txt
$ ls -li
12345 -rw-r--r--  2 user group 12 Dec 9 14:22 hardlink.txt
12345 -rw-r--r--  2 user group 12 Dec 9 14:22 original.txt
```
Here:
- Both files share the same inode (12345).
- The 2 under the hard link count shows that the inode is now referenced by two files.

#### Concept 2: What are Symbolic Links?
A symbolic link (symlink) is a special file that points to the path of another file.

#### Key points:
- A symlink is a separate inode and does not share the original file’s inode.
- It is essentially a shortcut and does not contain the actual data.
- If the target file is deleted, the symlink becomes broken (dangling link).
- Symlinks can span across different filesystems.
Example:
In the terminal:

```bash
$ ln -s original.txt symlink.txt
$ ls -li
12345 -rw-r--r--  1 user group 12 Dec 9 14:22 original.txt
54321 lrwxrwxrwx  1 user group 12 Dec 9 14:23 symlink.txt -> original.txt
```
Here:
- symlink.txt is a separate file with its own inode (54321).
- It points to original.txt, but does not share its content.

##### Let's Implement This in Zig!
1. Hard Links Example in Zig
This example demonstrates creating a hard link using Zig:

```zig
const std = @import("std");

pub fn main() !void {
    const original = "original.txt";
    const hardlink = "hardlink.txt";

    // Open the filesystem for operations
    const fs = std.fs.cwd();

    // Create a test file
    try fs.createFile(original).close();

    // Create a hard link
    try fs.link(original, hardlink);

    // Display success message
    std.debug.print("Hard link created: {s} -> {s}\n", .{hardlink, original});
}
```
- fs.link(original, hardlink): This creates a hard link.
- If you inspect with ls -li, both files will share the same inode.

#### Symbolic Links Example in Zig
This example demonstrates creating a symbolic link:

```zig
const std = @import("std");

pub fn main() !void {
    const original = "original.txt";
    const symlink = "symlink.txt";

    // Open the filesystem for operations
    const fs = std.fs.cwd();

    // Create a test file
    try fs.createFile(original).close();

    // Create a symbolic link
    try fs.symlink(original, symlink);

    // Display success message
    std.debug.print("Symbolic link created: {s} -> {s}\n", .{symlink, original});
}
```
- fs.symlink(original, symlink): This creates a symbolic link.
- If the target file (original.txt) is deleted, symlink.txt becomes a dangling link.

### Extended Attributes 
#### What are Extended Attributes (xattrs)?
- Extended attributes are like tags you can attach to files. Imagine a sticky note where you can write extra information (key/value pairs) about the file, which is not part of the file content itself.
- They are used to store metadata like file type, author, or custom application-specific data.
- Applications interact with xattrs using a common API, regardless of the underlying filesystem. However, the filesystem must support xattrs (e.g., ext4 does; FAT32 does not).

#### Key Components
- Keys: Unique identifiers for the data. Example: user.mime_type.
- Values: The data associated with a key. It can be binary or text.
- Namespaces: Organize attributes (e.g., user, system, security, trusted).

1. Checking if xattrs are Supported
Before working with xattrs, it's useful to confirm if the filesystem supports them. Filesystems like ext4 generally do, but not all do.

Zig Code Example
```zig
const std = @import("std");

pub fn main() !void {
    const file = try std.fs.cwd().createFile("test_file.txt", .{});
    defer file.close();

    const result = @intCast(isize, @import("libc").setxattr(
        "test_file.txt",
        "user.test_key",
        "test_value",
        10,
        0
    ));

    if (result == -1) {
        const errno = @import("libc").errno();
        if (errno == @import("libc").ENOTSUP) {
            std.debug.print("Extended attributes are not supported on this filesystem.\n", .{});
        } else {
            std.debug.print("Failed to set extended attribute. Errno: {d}\n", .{errno});
        }
    } else {
        std.debug.print("Extended attributes are supported!\n", .{});
    }
}
```
2. Retrieving an Extended Attribute
To retrieve an xattr, we need:
- File Path: The file we are querying.
- Key: The specific attribute we want.
If the attribute exists, we get its value; otherwise, an error is returned.

Zig Code Example
```zig
const std = @import("std");

pub fn main() !void {
    const allocator = std.heap.page_allocator;

    const file = try std.fs.cwd().createFile("test_file.txt", .{});
    defer file.close();

    // Assign an xattr for demonstration
    const set_result = @intCast(isize, @import("libc").setxattr(
        "test_file.txt",
        "user.demo_key",
        "demo_value",
        10,
        0
    ));
    if (set_result == -1) {
        std.debug.print("Failed to set xattr. Ensure your filesystem supports it.\n", .{});
        return;
    }

    // Retrieve the size of the xattr
    const attr_size = @intCast(isize, @import("libc").getxattr(
        "test_file.txt",
        "user.demo_key",
        null,
        0
    ));

    if (attr_size == -1) {
        std.debug.print("xattr retrieval failed.\n", .{});
        return;
    }

    // Allocate buffer for the xattr value
    var buffer = try allocator.alloc(u8, attr_size);

    // Fetch the xattr value
    const value_size = @intCast(isize, @import("libc").getxattr(
        "test_file.txt",
        "user.demo_key",
        buffer.ptr,
        attr_size
    ));

    if (value_size == -1) {
        std.debug.print("Failed to read xattr value.\n", .{});
        return;
    }

    std.debug.print("Retrieved xattr value: {s}\n", .{buffer.ptr[0..attr_size]});
}
```

3. Setting an Extended Attribute
To set an xattr, you need:
- File Path: The target file.
- Key: The name of the attribute.
- Value: The data you want to store.
- Flags: Controls behavior (e.g., create only if the key doesn’t exist).
Zig Code Example
```zig
const std = @import("std");

pub fn main() !void {
    const file = try std.fs.cwd().createFile("test_file.txt", .{});
    defer file.close();

    const key = "user.custom_key";
    const value = "custom_value";

    const result = @intCast(isize, @import("libc").setxattr(
        "test_file.txt",
        key,
        value,
        @sizeOf(@TypeOf(value)),
        0 // No specific flags
    ));

    if (result == -1) {
        const errno = @import("libc").errno();
        std.debug.print("Failed to set xattr. Errno: {d}\n", .{errno});
    } else {
        std.debug.print("Successfully set xattr: {s} = {s}\n", .{key, value});
    }
}
```

4. Deleting an Extended Attribute
To remove an xattr:
- Specify the file and the key.

If the key doesn’t exist, an error occurs.
Zig Code Example
```zig
const std = @import("std");

pub fn main() !void {
    const file = try std.fs.cwd().createFile("test_file.txt", .{});
    defer file.close();

    const key = "user.custom_key";

    const result = @intCast(isize, @import("libc").removexattr(
        "test_file.txt",
        key
    ));

    if (result == -1) {
        const errno = @import("libc").errno();
        std.debug.print("Failed to remove xattr. Errno: {d}\n", .{errno});
    } else {
        std.debug.print("Successfully removed xattr: {s}\n", .{key});
    }
}
```
## Directories
In Unix, a directory is essentially a container that holds a list of filenames. These filenames map to inode numbers, which are used by the system to locate the actual data on the device.

Here's a breakdown of the important points:

1. Directory Entries and Inodes:
- A directory contains directory entries. Each directory entry is a filename that is linked to an inode number.
- An inode is a data structure that stores information about a file, except its name and its data (such as file size, permissions, timestamps, and location on disk).

2. Directories and Subdirectories:
- Directories can contain other directories. These are called subdirectories.
- For example, in a path like /home/user/docs/, the /home/user/ directory contains a subdirectory called docs.

3. The Root Directory:
- The root directory is the top-level directory in the filesystem hierarchy. It is represented by / and contains all other directories.
- All other directories, except the root, are subdirectories of some parent directory.

4. Pathnames:
- A pathname refers to a file or directory and includes the directory names leading up to the file. It can be absolute or relative.
- An absolute pathname starts from the root directory (e.g., /usr/bin/sextant).
- A relative pathname does not start from the root directory and depends on the current working directory (e.g., bin/sextant).

5. Dot (.) and Dot-dot (..) Directories:
- Every directory contains two special directory entries: . (dot) and .. (dot-dot).
- `.` refers to the directory itself.
- `..` refers to the parent directory of the current directory.
For example, /home/user/docs/.. is the same as /home/user/.

### Creating Directories
In Linux and Unix-like systems, the creation of directories is handled through the mkdir() system call. A directory in a filesystem is a special file that holds filenames and their associated inode numbers, essentially providing a way to organize files in a hierarchical structure.

- path: This is the pathname of the directory that you want to create. It can be either a relative or an absolute pathname.
- mode: This is a permission mask (a set of flags) that determines the access rights for the new directory. These permissions are specified using octal values, with each bit representing a different permission. The most common permissions are:
- S_IRUSR (read permission for the owner)
- S_IWUSR (write permission for the owner)
- S_IXUSR (execute/search permission for the owner)
- S_IRGRP, S_IWGRP, S_IXGRP for the group
- S_IROTH, S_IWOTH, S_IXOTH for others
Example:

```c
#include <sys/stat.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main() {
    const char *dir_name = "example_directory";
    int ret = mkdir(dir_name, 0755); // 0755 gives full read, write, and execute permissions to the owner, and read and execute permissions to others.

    if (ret == -1) {
        perror("mkdir failed");
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }

    printf("Directory '%s' created successfully\n", dir_name);
    return 0;
}
```
Explanation of mkdir() call:

- If mkdir() is successful, it returns 0, creating the directory with the specified name and permissions.
- If it fails, it returns -1 and sets the errno variable to indicate the error, such as EEXIST (directory already exists), EACCES (no permission), or ENAMETOOLONG (the directory name is too long).

### Why the mode argument is important:
The mode specifies the permissions for the newly created directory. For example:
- 0755 means that the owner of the directory has full permissions (read, write, and execute), while others have only read and execute permissions.
- The operating system’s umask (user file creation mask) further modifies these permissions. The umask is a mask applied to file creation permissions to exclude certain permissions.

For example, if the current umask is 0022, it would automatically subtract write permissions from the group and others when creating a directory. If you attempt to create a directory with the mkdir() call, and the umask modifies the requested permissions, the actual permissions may be different from what you specified.

### Common Errors in mkdir():
- EEXIST: The directory already exists.
- EACCES: Permission denied for creating the directory (you don't have the necessary access).
- ENOSPC: No space left on the device to create the directory.
- ENAMETOOLONG: The directory name exceeds the maximum length allowed.
Important Note: When you create a directory, it doesn't automatically create parent directories if they don't exist. If you need to create parent directories as well, you can either manually create them first or use the -p option in the shell (for example, mkdir -p /parent/child). The mkdir() system call in C does not have an equivalent to this, so you would need to write additional code to handle parent directories.

### Removing Directories
To remove directories in Linux and Unix-like systems, the rmdir() function is used. It is the counterpart to the mkdir() function, which creates directories. The rmdir() function removes an empty directory from the filesystem.
- path: This is the directory to be removed. It must be empty, except for the . (dot) and .. (dot-dot) directories, which are required for directory navigation.
#### Return Value:
- On Success: rmdir() returns 0, indicating that the directory has been successfully removed.
- On Failure: rmdir() returns -1 and sets errno to one of the following error codes:
#### Common Error Codes for rmdir():
- EACCES: The process does not have write access to the parent directory, or one of the directories in the path is not searchable.
- EBUSY: The directory is currently in use (e.g., it is a mount point).
- EFAULT: Invalid memory reference for path.
- EINVAL: The directory path ends with . (dot).
- ELOOP: Too many symbolic links encountered while resolving the path.
- ENAMETOOLONG: The path exceeds the system’s limit for directory name length.
- ENOENT: One or more components in the path does not exist, or the path is a dangling symbolic link.
- ENOMEM: Insufficient kernel memory to complete the request.
- ENOTDIR: One or more components in the path is not a directory.
- ENOTEMPTY: The directory is not empty and contains entries other than . and ...
- EPERM: The process does not have permission to remove the directory due to the sticky bit or filesystem restrictions.
- EROFS: The filesystem containing the directory is read-only.

### Reading a Directory's Contents
To read the contents of a directory, the POSIX standard provides a set of functions that allow a program to obtain a list of files in a given directory. These functions are useful for tasks such as implementing a file listing tool (e.g., ls), searching for files that match a pattern, or operating on all files in a directory.

#### Opening a Directory Stream:
To begin reading the contents of a directory, you need to create a directory stream using the opendir() function. The directory stream represents the directory that you will be reading from.
- name: The path to the directory you want to open.
##### Return Value:
- On success: Returns a pointer to a DIR object (a directory stream).
- On failure: Returns NULL, and errno is set to indicate the error.

#### Reading from a Directory Stream:
Once you have a directory stream, you can use the readdir() function to read the contents of the directory. Each call to readdir() returns the next directory entry.

```c
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <dirent.h>

struct dirent *readdir(DIR *dir);
```
##### Return Value:
- On success: Returns a pointer to a struct dirent, which contains information about the directory entry.
- On failure: Returns NULL. You can check errno to distinguish between an error and the end of the directory entries.
##### struct dirent:
The struct dirent contains metadata about a directory entry. It includes the following fields:
```c
struct dirent {
    ino_t d_ino;           /* inode number */
    off_t d_off;           /* offset to next dirent */
    unsigned short d_reclen; /* length of this record */
    unsigned char d_type;  /* type of file */
    char d_name[256];      /* filename */
};
```
- d_name: The name of the file or directory (this is the only field that is strictly required by POSIX).
- d_ino: The inode number of the file or directory.
- d_type: The type of file (e.g., directory, regular file, symbolic link).
- d_reclen and d_off: These are implementation-specific fields, useful when working with the underlying filesystem.

Example Code for Reading Directory Contents:
Here’s a function find_file_in_dir() that searches for a file in a directory using readdir():

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <dirent.h>
#include <errno.h>

int find_file_in_dir(const char *path, const char *file) {
    DIR *dir = opendir(path);
    if (dir == NULL) {
        perror("opendir failed");
        return 1;
    }

    struct dirent *entry;
    int ret = 1; // Default return value, assuming file is not found
    errno = 0;
    while ((entry = readdir(dir)) != NULL) {
        if (strcmp(entry->d_name, file) == 0) {
            ret = 0; // File found
            break;
        }
    }

    if (errno && entry == NULL) {
        perror("readdir failed");
    }

    closedir(dir);
    return ret;
}
```
#### Closing the Directory Stream:
Once you're done reading from a directory, you should close the directory stream using closedir():

```c
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <dirent.h>

int closedir(DIR *dir);
```
##### Return Value:
- On success: Returns 0.
- On failure: Returns -1 and sets errno to EBADF, indicating that dir is not a valid directory stream.
##### System Calls for Reading Directory Contents
While opendir(), readdir(), and closedir() are the standard POSIX library functions for reading directory contents, internally, they rely on system calls like readdir() and getdents(). These system calls provide lower-level access to directory entries.
- readdir(): Reads a directory entry from a directory stream.
- getdents(): A system call that provides the details of a directory's entries. It is more low-level and not recommended for user-space applications due to its complexity.

###### Example of readdir() System Call:
```c
#include <unistd.h>
#include <linux/types.h>
#include <linux/dirent.h>
```

- int readdir(unsigned int fd, struct dirent *dirp, unsigned int count);
- fd: The file descriptor for the directory.
- dirp: A pointer to a buffer that will hold the directory entry.
- count: The number of bytes to read from the directory.

##### Conclusion
- Removing directories: Use rmdir() to remove empty directories. It requires the directory to be empty (except for the dot directories) and will return an error if the directory is not empty or if there are other issues.
- Reading directories: To read a directory's contents, use opendir(), readdir(), and closedir(). These functions provide a simple interface for traversing directories in C. The dirent structure holds details about each entry in the directory, which can be processed or filtered as needed.

#### Hard Links
- A hard link is a mapping between a name (in a directory) and an inode (which represents the file on the filesystem).
- Multiple hard links can point to the same inode, meaning that the same file can be accessed by different names in the filesystem, as long as they are on the same filesystem.
- Each link is equivalent; there is no "original" or "primary" link. All links to an inode are equal, and if one link is deleted, others will still point to the same file.
- When a file has no more links (i.e., its link count reaches 0), the file’s blocks are freed. However, if a process has the file open, it will not be removed until the process closes the file.

Example:
To create a hard link:

```c
#include <unistd.h>

int ret;
ret = link("/home/kidd/privateer", "/home/kidd/pirate");
if (ret)
    perror("link");
```
This code creates a new directory entry /home/kidd/pirate that points to the same inode as /home/kidd/privateer.

#### Symbolic Links (Symlinks)
- A symbolic link (or symlink) is a special type of file that contains a pathname to another file, called the target. Unlike hard links, symlinks are not inodes themselves, but they reference files using paths.
- Symlinks can span filesystems, unlike hard links, and can even point to files that don’t exist (creating dangling symlinks).
- They are easier to distinguish from regular files since their target path is stored in the symlink file itself.
Example:
To create a symbolic link:

```c
#include <unistd.h>

int ret;
ret = symlink("/home/kidd/privateer", "/home/kidd/pirate");
if (ret)
    perror("symlink");
```
This creates a symlink /home/kidd/pirate that points to /home/kidd/privateer.

#### Key Differences Between Hard Links and Symlinks
1. Hard Links:
- Can only exist within the same filesystem.
- Are indistinguishable from the original file.
- When all links to a file are removed, the file is deleted.
2. Symbolic Links:
- Can span filesystems.
- Can point to nonexistent files (dangling symlinks).
- Are a separate file that contains the path to the target file.
#### Common Errors with link() and symlink() Calls
- EACCES: Permission issues (search permission or write permission).
- EEXIST: The target already exists and cannot be overwritten.
- ENOENT: A component in the path does not exist.
- EXDEV: The paths belong to different filesystems (applicable for hard links).
- ELOOP: Too many symbolic links encountered, leading to a loop.

These system calls (link() and symlink()) provide the mechanism to create these links in a filesystem.

#### Unlinking
Unlinking is the process of removing a file or directory from the filesystem by deleting its pathname. The system call that performs this task is unlink(). This call is used to remove a single link (or pathname) from the filesystem.

##### unlink() System Call
```c
#include <unistd.h>
int unlink(const char *pathname);
```
- Description: The unlink() function removes the specified pathname from the filesystem. If the given pathname was the last reference to a file, the file is deleted from the filesystem. However, if any processes have the file open, the kernel will delay the actual removal until all processes close the file.
- Return Value: On success, it returns 0. On failure, it returns -1 and sets errno to one of the following error codes.
##### Error Codes for unlink()
- EACCES: The process does not have write permission for the parent directory of the specified pathname, or it lacks search permission for a component in the pathname.
- EFAULT: Invalid pointer for the pathname.
- EIO: I/O error.
- EISDIR: Pathname refers to a directory, which cannot be removed using unlink().
- ELOOP: Too many symbolic links encountered while traversing the pathname.
- ENAMETOOLONG: The pathname is too long.
- ENOENT: A component in the pathname does not exist.
- ENOMEM: Insufficient memory to complete the request.
- ENOTDIR: A component in the pathname is not a directory.
- EPERM: The system does not allow the unlinking of files.
- EROFS: The filesystem containing the pathname is read-only.
##### Behavior of unlink()
- If the given pathname is a regular file, the link is removed from the filesystem. If no other links to the file exist and no processes have it open, the file's data is marked as free and made available for reuse.
- If the pathname refers to a symbolic link, the link itself is deleted, but the target file remains unaffected.
- If the pathname refers to a special file (e.g., device file, FIFO, or socket), the file is removed, but any processes that have it open may continue to use it.

##### remove() Function
The remove() function is a higher-level C function that can be used to delete files or directories. It automatically calls the appropriate system calls based on the type of the file.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
int remove(const char *path);
```
- Description: The remove() function deletes a file or directory specified by path. If the path is a file, it calls unlink() to remove the file. If the path is a directory, it calls rmdir() to remove the directory.
- Return Value: On success, it returns 0. On failure, it returns -1 and sets errno to one of the relevant error codes defined for unlink() or rmdir().

##### Important Notes:
- unlink() does not remove directories. To remove directories, the rmdir() function should be used.
- A file is only truly removed from the filesystem when it has no links left, and no process has it open.

### Copying and Moving Files
Copying and moving files are fundamental tasks in file management. Although Unix provides system calls for moving files, it does not provide a native system call for copying. Let's look at each of these operations in detail:

#### Copying Files
Copying a file involves duplicating the file's contents under a new pathname. This is different from creating a hard link, where changes to one file would affect the other. In copying, the two files become independent copies.

Steps for Copying a File:
1. Open the source file (src).
2. Open the destination file (dst), creating it if it doesn't exist and truncating it to zero length if it does exist.
3. Read chunks of data from the source file.
4. Write the chunks to the destination file.
5. Continue reading and writing until the entire source file has been copied.
6. Close the destination file.
7. Close the source file.
If copying a directory, the process is more complex, as mkdir() must be used to create the directory, and each file within the directory must be copied individually.

Since Unix does not include a built-in system call for copying files, utilities like cp or file managers like GNOME's file manager handle this task.

#### Moving Files
Moving a file is simply renaming the directory entry under which the file resides. This operation does not create a second copy of the file, but changes its pathname.

rename() System Call
```c
#include <stdio.h>
int rename(const char *oldpath, const char *newpath);
```

- Description: This function renames the file or directory from oldpath to newpath. The file’s contents and inode remain the same.
- Return Value: On success, it returns 0. On failure, it returns -1 and sets errno to one of the following error codes:
- EACCES: The process lacks permission to modify the parent directory or to write to oldpath.
- EBUSY: Either oldpath or newpath is a mount point.
- EFAULT: Invalid pointer for oldpath or newpath.
- EINVAL: newpath is contained within oldpath, causing an invalid rename operation.
- EISDIR: newpath is a directory, but oldpath is not.
- ELOOP: Too many symbolic links encountered while resolving paths.
- ENAMETOOLONG: Pathname is too long.
- ENOENT: A component in the pathname does not exist.
- ENOMEM: Insufficient memory to complete the operation.
- ENOSPC: No space left on the device.
- ENOTDIR: A component is not a directory, or oldpath is a directory while newpath is not.
- ENOTEMPTY: The target directory is not empty.
- EPERM: Permission denied due to security restrictions.
- EROFS: The filesystem is read-only.
- EXDEV: The oldpath and newpath reside on different filesystems.

#### Behavior When Moving Files
Here’s a quick summary of how rename() behaves depending on the source and destination:

|Source | Destination is a File | Destination is a Directory | Destination is a Link | Destination Does Not Exist |
|:------|:----------------------|:---------------------------|:----------------------|:--------------------------:|
| File |	Overwrites destination with the source file.|	Fails with EISDIR.|	Renames the file and overwrites destination.|	File is renamed. |
| Directory |	Fails with ENOTDIR.	| Renames source directory if destination is empty, or fails with ENOTEMPTY.|	- |	- |
| Link | Renames the link and overwrites the destination.|	Fails with EISDIR.|	Renames the link.| Link is renamed.|
| Does Not Exist |	Fails with ENOENT.|	Fails with ENOENT.|	Fails with ENOENT.|	Fails with ENOENT.|
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#### Important Considerations:
- Cross-filesystem Moves: The rename() call cannot move files across different filesystems. In such cases, utilities like mv will first copy the file and then unlink the original.
- Mount Points: You cannot rename across different mount points, even if they are backed by the same device.
- Permissions: Moving or renaming files may fail if there are permission issues with the parent directories or if the filesystem is read-only.
Device Nodes
Device nodes are special files used for interfacing with device drivers in Unix-like operating systems. These files allow user-space applications to interact with hardware devices, such as storage devices, network interfaces, and peripherals, without needing to know the specifics of the device's operation. When a program performs I/O operations (like reading or writing) on a device node, the kernel passes the requests to the appropriate device driver, which then manages the interaction with the hardware.

#### Major and Minor Numbers
Each device node is associated with two numeric identifiers:

- Major number: Identifies the type of device and which device driver should handle the requests.
- Minor number: Specifies a particular instance of the device (e.g., a specific disk or network interface).
The kernel uses these numbers to route requests to the appropriate device driver. If the major and minor numbers do not correspond to a valid device driver, the system returns an error (ENODEV).

#### Special Device Nodes
There are several predefined device nodes that have specific, useful purposes in the Linux environment. These devices are part of the Linux ABI and are always available on all systems.

1. /dev/null (Major: 1, Minor: 3)
Discards any written data and always returns EOF (End of File) on read. It’s commonly used to discard unwanted output or as a data sink.
2. /dev/zero (Major: 1, Minor: 5)
Discards written data and provides an infinite stream of null bytes (0x00) when read. Useful for creating empty files or as a data source.
3. /dev/full (Major: 1, Minor: 7)
Discards written data but returns EOF when read. Write operations always result in the ENOSPC error, indicating that the device is full.
These special devices are particularly useful for testing, as they allow you to simulate certain edge cases (like full filesystems) or simply discard unnecessary data without overhead.

#### Random Number Generation
Linux provides two special device nodes for random number generation:

1. /dev/random (Major: 1, Minor: 8)
2. /dev/urandom (Major: 1, Minor: 9)
Both of these devices gather entropy (randomness) from various sources like hardware events, system activity, or user input. The kernel mixes this entropy into an "entropy pool," which is used to generate random numbers.

- /dev/random: Returns cryptographically strong random numbers, but can block if the kernel’s entropy pool is insufficient. It's typically used for security-sensitive applications like key generation.

- /dev/urandom: Does not block and provides random numbers even if the entropy pool is low. It is generally sufficient for most non-security-critical applications.

#### Out-of-Band Communication with ioctl()
Sometimes, applications need to communicate with devices or perform operations that go beyond normal file I/O, such as reading device status or configuring a serial port. This can be done using the ioctl() system call, which allows programs to send control commands to devices or drivers.

The ioctl() function has the following signature:

```c
int ioctl(int fd, int request, ...);
```
- fd: File descriptor of the device or file.
- request: A predefined request code indicating the operation to perform.

Additional parameters may be passed depending on the operation, often to provide data to or receive data from the device.
For example, the following code demonstrates how to eject a CD-ROM using ioctl():

```c
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <sys/stat.h>
#include <fcntl.h>
#include <sys/ioctl.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <linux/cdrom.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
    int fd, ret;

    if (argc < 2) {
        fprintf(stderr, "usage: %s <device to eject>\n", argv[0]);
        return 1;
    }

    fd = open(argv[1], O_RDONLY | O_NONBLOCK);
    if (fd < 0) {
        perror("open");
        return 1;
    }

    ret = ioctl(fd, CDROMEJECT, 0);
    if (ret) {
        perror("ioctl");
        return 1;
    }

    ret = close(fd);
    if (ret) {
        perror("close");
        return 1;
    }

    return 0;
}
```
This program opens the CD-ROM device specified by the user, sends the CDROMEJECT ioctl request to eject the disk, and then closes the device. The kernel forwards the request to the CD-ROM device driver, which handles the physical action of ejecting the tray.

#### Conclusion
Device nodes play a crucial role in Unix-like systems by providing an abstraction layer for hardware devices. By using device nodes and mechanisms like ioctl(), user applications can interact with hardware in a consistent way, without needing to know the details of the device's implementation. These concepts allow for powerful, flexible device management and control, which is central to the Unix philosophy of modularity and simplicity.

The next topic, "Monitoring File Events," focuses on how to use Linux's inotify API to monitor file and directory events, which is useful for applications that need real-time updates on file changes, such as a file manager, backup utility, or data-indexing tool.

#### Key Points of the Topic:
1. Problem Addressed by inotify:
Inotify helps solve the problem of outdated or inconsistent directory views in applications, like file managers, by pushing file events as they happen. For example, when a file is added to or deleted from a directory, inotify notifies the application immediately.

2. Inotify Initialization:
To use inotify, you must first initialize it using the inotify_init1() system call, which returns a file descriptor. The function takes an optional flag to set options like IN_CLOEXEC or IN_NONBLOCK.
Example:
```c
int fd = inotify_init1(0);
if (fd == -1) {
    perror("inotify_init1");
    exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
}
```

3. Setting up Watches:
Once initialized, you set up watches on files or directories using inotify_add_watch(), where you specify the file/directory path and the events you're interested in (e.g., reads, writes, creation, deletion).
Example:

```c
int wd = inotify_add_watch(fd, "/etc", IN_ACCESS | IN_MODIFY);
if (wd == -1) {
    perror("inotify_add_watch");
    exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
}
```
4. Watch Masks:
The mask specifies the events to watch for. Some common events include:
- IN_ACCESS: The file was read.
- IN_MODIFY: The file was written to.
- IN_CREATE: A file was created in the directory.
- IN_DELETE: A file was deleted from the directory.
- IN_MOVED_FROM: A file was moved out of the directory.
- IN_MOVED_TO: A file was moved into the directory.
These can be combined using a bitwise OR to watch for multiple events.

5. inotify_event Structure:
The structure representing the events contains information such as:
- wd: Watch descriptor, which helps link events to specific watches.
- mask: The events that occurred.
- cookie: A unique value used to link related events (especially for move events).
- len: Length of the name field (if the event is for a file in a directory).
- name[]: The name of the affected file (if applicable).

6. Reading Events:

Events are read from the inotify file descriptor. The kernel supports reading multiple events at once, which is helpful when monitoring many files or directories.
Example:

```c
char buf[BUF_LEN];
ssize_t len, i = 0;
len = read(fd, buf, BUF_LEN);
while (i < len) {
    struct inotify_event *event = (struct inotify_event *) &buf[i];
    printf("wd=%d mask=%d cookie=%d len=%d dir=%s\n",
           event->wd, event->mask, event->cookie, event->len,
           (event->mask & IN_ISDIR) ? "yes" : "no");
    if (event->len) {
        printf("name=%s\n", event->name);
    }
    i += sizeof(struct inotify_event) + event->len;
}
```

7. Handling Advanced Events:

- Some special events:
    - IN_IGNORED: The watch was removed (either manually or because the watched object no longer exists).
    - IN_ISDIR: Indicates the event is for a directory.
    - IN_Q_OVERFLOW: The event queue overflowed (a warning that events are being dropped).
    - IN_UNMOUNT: The device backing the watched object was unmounted.

8. Handling Move Events:
For file moves, the IN_MOVED_FROM and IN_MOVED_TO events are generated. To track the full move, the cookie field can be used to link these events together.

#### Example Use Case:
A file manager could use inotify to watch for changes in the files within a directory. If a file is created, modified, or deleted, the file manager can immediately update the display.
##### Code Example Recap:
The code provided demonstrates how to:
- Initialize inotify.
- Add watches for events like file access and modification.
- Read events from the inotify file descriptor.
- Handle and print relevant details about each event.

In summary, inotify provides a real-time, efficient way to monitor file events without the overhead of periodically scanning directories, making it ideal for applications that need to respond to file changes immediately.
